Linear Programming - Class of optimization tasks where both constraints and optimization criterion are linear functions. 

Given a set of variables, we want to 
1. satisfy a set of linear equations and/or linear inequalities involving the variables
2. maximize or minimize a given lenear objective function

Constraints make up the half-space
the set of all feasable solutions lies in the intersection of the half-space
The space of feasable solutions creates a convex polygon

Vertices give us the optimal solution. The objective function gives us a line. This line is parallel to itself no matter where we move it in the space. Therefore, we want to move it accordingly
(either as far up or as far down as possible).

Solving linear programs
You can solve them by using the simplex method.
